👋 Howdy! I’m @XYZG0, the coder your mom warned you about.

👀 I’m interested in taking long walks... to the fridge.

🌱 I’m currently learning how to cook instant noodles without burning the house down.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on world domination, one bad commit at a time.

📫 How to reach me? Well, if you can figure out my carrier pigeon schedule, you’re in luck!

😄 Pronouns: Lord/Overlord (But I also accept "Hey you!")

⚡ Fun fact: I can write bugs faster than I can fix them. Also, I’m fluent in 0.5 programming languages.

XYZG0/XYZG0 is a ✨ legendary ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) will one day appear in history books as the reason for the robot uprising.
